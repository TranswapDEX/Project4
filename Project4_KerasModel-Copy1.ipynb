      "H: Fairfax Media has launched the End the Cycle campaign in a bid to end the national disgrace^ of violence against women. New findings from peak prevention organisation Our Watch have found more than a quarter of young people hold attitudes that put them at risk of perpetrating^ or tolerating^ violence against women. Troubling^ statistics like this have prompted the group - which is pushing for an end to violence against women and their children - to launch a new campaign with the message: “You can’t undo violence”.^ The group's research revealed many young people hold \"disturbing\"^ gender attitudes that support violence against women, as a third of people aged 12 to 24 do not think exerting^ control over someone is a form of violence. One in four thought it was \"pretty^ normal\"^ for a guy to pressure a girl into sex and a quarter did not think it was serious if a \"normally^ gentle\"^ guy slapped his girlfriend when he was drunk during an argument. Our Watch ambassador and former AFL star and call out sexist behaviour or jokes that diminish or belittle.^ He said reaching gender equality was key - without it relationships become controlling,^ and a quarter of young people said someone had \"crossed^ the line\"^ with them in a relationship. Lisa O'Reilly,^ a member of Our Watch's^ digital youth committee, said social stereotypes about girls and boys could foster inequality in relationships. The 19-year-old said couples needed to respect each other and communicate honestly about their relationships..^ \"We need to break down those barriers,^ so hopefully it won't be a norm in the future,\" Lisa said. \"I hope ... as people start to realise and talk about how this isn't OK, we will stop seeing so much acceptance and turning a blind eye to violence against women.\"^ She said she experienced vast differences in the way she and her younger brother were treated - while he was allowed to go out, she was expected to do more cooking and cleaning.^ In her relationship, she said some of her boyfriend's^ questions - like asking her to dress a certain way - did cross the line in terms of respect. \"It is important to make sure that you both change equally and together, instead of one person being in control,\"^ she said. The “You can’t undo violence”^ campaign uses a series of compelling images to deliver the message that violent and controlling behaviour is something that lives with the people involved forever - like a tattoo it leaves an indelible^ mark that is not easily removed. The campaign comes as the federal government committed $100 million to combating violence against women. It also follows the release of VicHealth^ figures showing one in five young Australians believed women were partially responsible for sexual assault and nearly half thought tracking a partner by electronic means without consent was acceptable. Fairfax Media has combined with Our Watch to End the Cycle of violence against women. If you or someone you know is experiencing violence or sexual assault, phone 1800RESPECT^ on 1800 737 732.^ ONE in five young people blame the victim of sexual assault while almost half think tracking a partner electronically is acceptable,^ according to a new health report. The national study showed young people were more likely to hold attitudes that contributed to violence against women than their older counterparts. Nearly three in five people believed violence was caused by men being unable to control their anger, with 40 per cent thinking rape resulted from men not being able to control their sexual urges.^ One in five believed women often said “no”^ when they meant “yes”^ and the same number thought women were partly responsible for sexual violence committed against them. The report, by VicHealth,^ was released as the federal government unveiled a $100 million safety package to protect women victims of violence. Member of the Council of Australian Governments advisory panel on violence against women Julie Oberin^ said it was a “major^ breakthrough”^ for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to acknowledge violence against women was caused by gender inequality. “I’m really heartened^ they have recognised the real cause and problem, so they know the solution is around raising gender equality,”^ Ms Oberin^ said. She said the attitudes of young people were a reflection of their broader community. “We've^ got to acknowledge responsibility - we can't keep blaming young people for reflecting back what they are getting back from their major influences,^ like their sporting coaches, their parents and their teachers,”^ she said. There was still a tendency,^ she said, to minimise the violence or blame the victim by asking ‘Why^ doesn’t she just leave?’^ “If she leaves, she could get killed,”^ Ms Oberin^ said. This year 66 women have died due to gendered^ violence – many at the hands of a partner or former partner. Four women have been killed in the past week. Ms Oberin^ called for a social change and urged people to instead question why the perpetrator^ had not been stopped by the system or why their violence was sanctioned by their family and friends.\n",

      "H: ANN7^ (DStv^ 405)^ in a statement now says Christina Aguilera^ dumped the South African 24-hour TV news channel's^ upcoming South African of the Year Awards because she is judging The Voice.^ The problem is that someone appears to be lying.^ The judges for the upcoming 9th season of The Voice on NBC starting on 21 September in the United States were announced back in July already and Christina Aguilera^ was replaced by Gwen Stefani^ who will be judging for her second season. UPDATE 27 September:^ Christina Aguilera^ is a judge on the 10th season of The Voice which will be broadcast in 2016 and although the 9th season just started on TV in America, the \"blind^ auditions\"^ for the 10th season is now being filmed with filming dates that were moved.^ And if it was true that Christina Aguilera^ is judging The Voice,^ why did ANN7^ and Infinity Media choose her initially and not do due diligence beforehand^ which would have revealed that Christina Aguilera^ is not signable^ for a live performance in South Africa because she will be a judge?^ It's all incredibly embarrassing for ANN7,^ the South African of the Year Awards and for Christina Aguilera.^ The reputation of a media outlet like ANN7^ which is in the news business is heavily based on values like honesty, transparency and above all credibility.^ This latest sudden about-turn^ and having to backtrack^ on announcements and making a mockery^ of what the South African of the Year Awards 2015 was announced as initially,^ once again dents^ and inflicts^ damage on whatever credibility ANN7^ has. \"Christina^ Aguilera^ has had to withdrawn due to a change in scheduling of the top-rated show The Voice on which she is one of the judges,\"^ says ANN7^ in a statement released on Friday morning. ANN7^ goes on: \"The schedule change requires her to be in the United States on the day of the South African of the Year Awards show.\"^ NBC in America has not made any schedule changes whatsoever to its schedule for the upcoming 9th season of The Voice - on which Christina Aguilera^ is not a judge. ANN7^ will now be refunding^ all tickets to those who've already bought tickets for the South African of the Year Awards 2015 set for 17 October at the Ticketpro^ Dome in Randburg,^ Johannesburg.^ The South African of the Year Awards 2015 will continue but will now suddenly become a private event. ANN7^ says \"anyone^ who has not heard from Ticketpro^ should call their call centre to ensure prompt refunding^ takes place\"^ Moegsien^ Williams, editor-in-chief for ANN7^ and SATY2015^ organiser says in a statement ANN7^ is \"deeply^ disappointed\"^ that it will suddenly no longer be able to bring Christina Aguilera^ to South Africa but that ANN7^ \"understands^ that she has contractual obligations that she must meet\".^ The South African of the Year Awards 2015 will still be a live broadcast on the channel on 17 October.\n",
